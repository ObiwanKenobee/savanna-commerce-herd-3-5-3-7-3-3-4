# Savanna Marketplace Admin Workflows

## Inter-Page Workflow Example: Stockout Alert Management

### Scenario: A supplier consistently triggers stockout alerts

**Step 1: Admin Dashboard → Spots "drought" in maize flour stock**

- 🦁 **Command Center** displays real-time alert: "Maize Stock Drought ⚠️"
- Wildebeest herd indicator shows high system load (server strain from demand)
- Growth lever suggests: "Auto-suggest competitive pricing to suppliers"

**Step 2: Marketplace Governance → Auto-flags supplier for restock**

- 🏞️ **Waterhole Rules** triggers acacia tree depletion alert
- AI predicts stockout in 3 days with 94% confidence
- System auto-sends restock nudge to supplier with data-driven suggestions

**Step 3: User Management → Checks supplier's "Elephant Memory" for past delays**

- 🦁 **Pride Control** reviews supplier's historical performance
- Elephant Memory profile shows: 234 orders, KSH 45K LTV, 850 credit score
- Previous stockout incidents: 2 in last 6 months (acceptable pattern)

**Step 4: Logistics Orchestration → Pre-books trucks for expected orders**

- 🦓 **Migration Paths** optimizes delivery routes in anticipation
- Safari driver James Mwangi (🐆 speed: 9.2, 🐘 care: 8.7, 🦏 reliability: 9.5) assigned
- Weather integration shows clear skies, moderate traffic on Nairobi-Thika route

**Step 5: Growth Toolkit → Expands maize supplier recruitment in affected region**

- 🌍 **Savanna Scalability** targets Western Kenya for new supplier onboarding
- Territory matrix shows: 78% supplier gaps, 85% market potential
- USSD onboarding campaign launched for rural maize farmers

**Step 6: Security & Compliance → Monitors for price manipulation**

- Monitors for coordinated price increases during shortage
- Maintains ecosystem balance and prevents predatory pricing
