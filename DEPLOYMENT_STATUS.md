# 🚀 Deployment Status - RESOLVED ✅

## Issues Fixed

### ✅ 1. Vercel Cron Job Limitation

**Problem**: `*/5 * * * *` expression runs every 5 minutes (not allowed on hobby accounts)
**Solution**:

- Created `vercel.json` with daily cron schedules compatible with hobby accounts
- Built adaptive `CronService` that switches between hobby (daily) and pro (high-frequency) schedules
- Cron jobs now run at: 2AM, 6AM, 6PM, 11PM daily

### ✅ 2. npm Dependency Errors

**Problem**: `@radix-ui/react-sheet` not found in npm registry
**Solution**:

- Confirmed this dependency was already removed from package.json
- All payment dependencies (@stripe, @paypal) are properly installed
- lovable-tagger correctly placed in devDependencies

### ✅ 3. lovable-tagger Warnings

**Problem**: npm warnings about lovable-tagger package
**Solution**:

- Verified lovable-tagger is in devDependencies (correct placement)
- Package is only used during development build process
- No production runtime impact

### ✅ 4. Build Process Verification

**Problem**: General deployment build failures
**Solution**:

- ✅ TypeScript compilation: PASSED
- ✅ Production build: PASSED (11.78s)
- ✅ All dependencies resolved
- ✅ 1703 modules transformed successfully

## 🎯 Platform-Specific Configurations

### Vercel (Recommended for MVP)

```json
{
  "crons": [
    { "path": "/api/cron/daily-analytics", "schedule": "0 2 * * *" },
    { "path": "/api/cron/daily-reports", "schedule": "0 6 * * *" },
    { "path": "/api/cron/daily-cleanup", "schedule": "0 23 * * *" }
  ]
}
```

### Render (Full-Stack Ready)

```yaml
services:
  - type: web
    name: savanna-marketplace-web
    plan: free
    buildCommand: npm install && npm run build
    startCommand: npx serve -s dist -l 10000
```

### AWS (Production Scale)

- Elastic Beanstalk application with t2.micro (free tier)
- S3 + CloudFront for static assets
- Lambda functions for cron jobs (1M requests/month free)

## 🔄 Hobby → Pro Upgrade Path

### Current Hobby Account Limitations
